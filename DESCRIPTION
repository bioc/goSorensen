Title: Statistical inference based on the Sorensen-Dice dissimilarity
        and the Gene Ontology (GO)
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Jordi Ocana, Pablo Flores, Alexandre Sanchez-Pla, Miquel Salicru

Description: This package implements inferential methods to compare gene lists (in this first 
    release, to prove equivalence) in terms of their biological meaning as expressed in the
    GO. The compared gene lists are characterized by cross-tabulation frequency tables of
    enriched GO items. Dissimilarity between gene lists is evaluated using the Sorensen-Dice index.
    The fundamental guiding principle is that two gene lists are taken as similar if they share a
    great proportion of common enriched GO items.
